In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to
form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an,
followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all
the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can
form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.
